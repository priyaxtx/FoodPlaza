A food plaza is an online food order system that allows users to check for various food available at the online site and can easily order food online. 
The project consists of a list of food items. 
The user may browse through these items as he/she wishes. If the user likes a product he/she may add it to his shopping cart.
Once the user wishes to cart a food item he/she can increase the quantity of food and the price will be automatically calculated according to quantity.
